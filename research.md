My research focuses on the intersection of modern historical theory, social informatics, and law. I am particularly interested in how new IT tools modify public historical understanding.

### Generative AI and Historical Education

The process of constructing history is vastly complicated and scholars have long debated the appropriate means by which to construct historical narratives and "truth". Modern historicism is already in flux, with debates between micro and macro historians, subjectivists, constructivists, and positivists as lively as ever. However, global trends toward nationalism and xenophobia are rising alongside the development of powerful new tools such as Generative AI. These new implements have the stunning potential to either empower users with new historical understanding, or to oppress them completely within a complex web of disinformation, propaganda, and inciteful rhetoric. My work seeks to understand the scope of use cases for Generative AI in empirical historicism and historical education practices and to define its mediating impacts on public engagement with historical materials and information.
