My research focuses on the intersection of modern historical theory, social informatics, and law. I am particularly interested in how new IT tools modify public historical understanding.

### Generative AI and Historical Education

The process of constructing history is vastly complicated and scholars have long debated the appropriate means by which to construct historical narratives and "truth". Modern historicism is already in flux, with debates between micro and macro historians, subjectivists, constructivists, and positivists as lively as ever. However, global trends toward nationalism and xenophobia are rising alongside the development of powerful new tools such as Generative AI. These new implements have the stunning potential to either empower users with new historical understanding, or to oppress them completely within a complex web of disinformation, propaganda, and inciteful rhetoric. My work seeks to understand the scope of use cases for Generative AI in empirical historicism and historical education practices and to define its mediating impacts on public engagement with historical materials and information. 

### Virtual Reality and Archaeology

Virtual Reality (VR) is expanding in its capability, affordability, and overall reach. Its influence has already spread into the world of education, with a proliferation of virtual education options available at institutions such as museums and others focused on archaeology and cultural heritage. Sites that are remote, difficult to access, or ecologically fragile now overwhelmingly favor virtual options. Given the possibility of future use in primary school settings, it would be of great utility to study the affordances and limitations in cultural heritage settings. 

### Constitutional legal Protections in Virtual Education Environments

There is great potential for an imminent embrace of virtual strategies for education. In virtual environments, students, teachers, and historical actors themselves would be represented by digital avatars. However, it is unclear what the rights of avatars are in such spaces, and what provisions are in place to protect human users. Human actors in virtual education environments may engage with non-human avatars operated by artificially intelligent entities. However, there is no legal guidance governing the development and conduct of such entities in their interactions with human users. 

## Collaborations

I am always interested in collaborating with fellow researchers and practitioners. If our interests align, please feel free to reach out!

## Research Philosophy

My approach to research emphasizes rigorous methodology, interdisciplinary collaboration, and practical applications that can make a real-world impact.
