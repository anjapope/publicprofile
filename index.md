# Welcome 

My name is Andrew Pope. I am a PhD student in Information Science at Indiana University. My research explores the nexus of social informatics and modern empirical historicism, with a focus on the introduction of generative AI and virtual reality. I apply an array of social science methodologies to augment my historical research, and to assess how the modern public engages with and interprets historical materials.
