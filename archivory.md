# My Work with ArchIvory

ArchIvory is a collaborative research project that draws on the expertise of historians, archaeologists, biologists, computer scientists, information scientists, and more. 

Our objective is to capitalize on the wealth of data available in extant ivory consumer goods that were produced before the global ban on the trade in such materials. Through means such as DNA sampling, isotope testing, and X-Ray flourescence, our team is able to reveal vital biographical details of the animals that provided the raw material to make products such as piano keys, billiard balls, weaponry, jewelry, and countless forms of ornamentation. With this information, we can reconstruct details of an elephant's life- its foodweb, the environments it traveled through, and the general conditions it experienced. 

Upon establishing the species and location of the elephants who were the source of ivory materials, the ArchIvory team can make assessments about ivory trade routes and the relationship between consumers and producers in different time periods. By drawing upon the skills of our historians and archivists, we can recreate these narratives for local communities and situate their experience and memories within global contexts. 

We are interested in the stories that people have to tell. While the raw data is of vital importance, data alone cannot fully capture the nature of the exchange and interplay between human communities and elephant populations over the past two thousand years. Whiie we cannot talk to ancient populations about their experience, we can talk to people in the present day. Utilizing methods borrowed from the social sciences, ArchIvory conducts semi-structured interviews. The connection with communities and everyday people is vital in its own right, and these conversations help us formulate the overall narrative we present to the public. We want to share these stories, as the phenomenon of the ivory market is a common demoninator that unites people across cultures. Moreover, through soliciting the opinions and memories of individuals and their families, we can get a better idea of the materials most commonly found in a given region.

Finally, our team is working on a unique database that will provide powerful user tools that will make it easy to determine an ivory item's place of origin and its likely story. We are a forward facing organization that plans on making the best use of new IT tools to advance both the arts and the sciences.
